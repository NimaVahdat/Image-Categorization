# Image-Categorization using Deep Spiking Neural Network
## Project Overview
The Image-Categorization project employs a Deep Spiking Neural Network (DSNN) for classifying images in the MNIST and Caltech101 datasets. Leveraging the Spyketorch framework, this project extracts features by creating a deep spiking neural network, followed by classifying the classes using Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Results
Caltech101: 96.296% accuracy
MNIST: 98.260% accuracy
