# Image-Categorization
## Image Categorization using Deep Spiking Neural Network.
This project classifies classes in MNIST and Caltech101 datasets using Spyketorch framework for extracting features by creating a deep sipiking neural network and then classifying the classes using Linear SVM.

Results:

Caltech101 -> 96.296%

MNIST -> 98.260%
